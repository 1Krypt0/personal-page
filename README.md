# My personal website

This is where my personal website will be stored. It is built from scratch with [Astro](https://astro.build/), as a static website tailored for my needs. The design was inspired by a [similar one](https://www.figma.com/community/file/882879599442878081) I found on Figma, with some changes to the typography. It is still a work in progress, but I am happy with the results so far.
